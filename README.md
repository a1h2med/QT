# IDE_For_MicroPython Project
It's a project which I've worked on for My Graduation Project as I was asked to make a new IDE For MicroPython development.

# TINY_parser_GUI_And_Syntax_tree
In this Project it was required to implement the TINY parser using recursive descent method and draw Syntax tree on a GUI based application.
I've used opencv to draw the synatx tree for it then I connected it with GUI.
