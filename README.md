# IDE_For_MicroPython Project
It's a project which I've worked on for My Graduation Project as I was asked to make a new IDE For MicroPython development.

# TINY_parser_GUI_And_Syntax_tree
In this Project it was required to implement the TINY parser using recursive descent method and draw Syntax tree on a GUI based application.
I've used opencv to draw the synatx tree for it then I connected it with GUI, (for yarab.py) it's a code made by my teammate as an implementation for checking the syntax inserted, and I need some of it in my code to get things cutted.

# GO_Back_N_Network_Assignment
In this assignment it was required to implement GO_Back_N_Protocol, Assuming any scenario you want, So in this GUI (After running it) you will get a window in which there's a brief introduction about GO_Back_N_Protocol, then After clicking next an input dialog will show up asking for number of transmissions, then a new window will show up printing the number of transmetted, received data...(for sender,receiver files it was made by my teammates).
